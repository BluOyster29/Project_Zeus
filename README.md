# Dialogue Systems Project
## Integration of Monzo Bank app with Talkamatic Dialogue Manager 

## Idea 
Monzo i a banking app from the uk that is a mobile based bank and does not have any branches. 
I have had the app for over a year now and it is a very convenient banking app, as I travel a lot as well it is also possible to take money out in other currencies and not incurr conversion fees, as well as this the rate is usually fairly good. 
That's enough advertising. Monzo have a number of apis available for the user to do basic things such as:
- Checking Balance
- Account details 
- Sent payments 
- Withdraw from saving accounts and more
My idea is to integrate TDM with Monzos apis to allow the user to use their voice to interact with their banking app.
